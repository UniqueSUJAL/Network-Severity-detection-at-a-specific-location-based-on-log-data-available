# Network Severity Detection Based on Log Data

# Overview

This Python script is designed to analyze log data and detect network severity at a specific location. By processing the available log data, the script identifies patterns and anomalies to determine the severity level of network issues at a particular location or node.

# Features

- **Log Data Analysis**: Parses and analyzes log data to identify network events and anomalies.
- **Severity Detection**: Determines the severity level of network issues based on predefined criteria and patterns in the log data.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows users to customize severity thresholds and criteria according to their specific requirements.
- **Alerting System**: Sends notifications or alerts when network severity surpasses certain thresholds, enabling timely response and action.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations or reports summarizing the network severity levels over time for better understanding and decision-making.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (specified in the script)

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/network-severity-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd network-severity-detection
```

3. Ensure you have the log data available in a compatible format and update the script accordingly.

4. Run the main Python script:

```bash
python network_severity_detection.py
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions or check the generated reports for network severity analysis.

## Configuration

You can customize the following parameters in the `network_severity_detection.py` script:

- **Log Data Source**: Specify the location and format of the log data to be analyzed.
- **Severity Thresholds**: Adjust the severity thresholds and criteria based on your network environment and requirements.
- **Notification Settings**: Configure the notification method and thresholds for sending alerts when network severity exceeds certain levels.
- **Visualization Options**: Customize the visualization settings to generate reports or graphs summarizing the network severity analysis results.
